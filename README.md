# PBR Texture Mapper

With this Blender addon you can create a PBR node setup for cycles or Eevee.

Example workflow for Substance Painter:

1. Export the PBR textures (Albedo, Roughness, Metallic & Normal (OpenGL))
2. Open the Blender 2.8 project with the 3d model that you added the textures for. 
3. In the Shader Editor for material (Cycles or Eevee with Principled Shader) drag the textures into the view.
4. Open the PTM tab and press the button "Map Textures"
